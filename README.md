Cricinfo GreaseMonkey script
============================

Simple script for greasemonkey that makes the mini-scorecard on 
espncricinfo.com more usable.

By default, the mini scorecard window is not sized correctly for the content, resulting in either a large block of white space or ugly scroll bars. This script dynamically sets the size of the window to exactly match the content.

Script also prompts user to confirm when closing the window, to prevent
accidentally closing the scorecard when closing Firefox windows.
